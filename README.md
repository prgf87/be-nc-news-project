# Northcoders News API

Welcome to my Northcoders Backend Project!

To follow along with me, you will need to do a few things before getting started.

Go to my online repository and create your own fork:
https://github.com/prgf87/nc-news-project

Then, navigate to your local directory and clone your newly created repo by using the command below.

`git clone <your-repo-name.git>`

Navigate into your newly cloned repo and use `code .` to launch VSCode.

Run `npm i` in your terminal to install all the necessary dependecies (make sure to navigate into your newly cloned folder before running this command!)

You will also have to create two .env files(.env.test & .env.development), one for test purposes, and one for development purposes.

.env.test example:
`PGDATABASE=nc_news_test`

Thank you and good luck!
